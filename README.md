# Poker

This code is about rules for checking Poker game hand. It will be used as an exercise for candidates. Original logic is in `exercise.rb` file and I extraced it to separate classes and behaviors through refactoring.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/womanonrails/poker.git
cd poker
bundle install
rspec ./spec
```
