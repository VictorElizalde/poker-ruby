# Poker

This code is about rules for checking Poker game hand. It was used as kata, to learn how to do refactoring. Step by step I cleaned up logic which originaly was in `hand.rb` file and I extraced it to separate classes and behaviors. Going through commits you can see my way of thinking.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/womanonrails/poker.git
cd poker
bundle install
rspec ./spec
```
